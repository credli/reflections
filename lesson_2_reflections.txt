## What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Technically, initializing a git repository will create a .git folder inside my project directory, which means a new repository for that directory was created.

## How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory is the folder containing the initialized git repository, it normally includes all files in that sub-directory.Staging area bundles the changes made on only the files added to it (i.e. must be committed), the value it offers is that it allows us to logically manage commits by choosing which files are going to be included.
