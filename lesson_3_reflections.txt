## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository when I want to share my code or let other users collaborate on my projects. I can also use remote repositories to access my own repositories from other devices, or to simply backup my project files.

## Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Since the tip of a master branch always point at the lastest commit, we don't want our local master to automatically point at commits newer than the ones we are still working on and haven't pushed yet.

## Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branch is a commit checkpoint label set on a repository, it creates a commit that tracks parent commits directly accessible to it.
Clone is to copy a repository from a remote source, or another location on your computer, to your local directory.
Fork is basically a "special" clone that Github does for you, storing necessary metadata that links to the original repository.

## What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This allows me to work offline while knowing what other collaborators have committed until that point. Say if we are working on fixing bugs in our application, doing this will show me what other collaborators committed so that I focus on unattended issues.

## How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

One way for collaborating on a project is by putting my working directory on an FTP site and creating multiple user accounts on that server. My collaborators would have read-only or read-write permissions on that folder. People who have read only access may suggest their changes in an email, or maybe send their changes back to administrators asking them to diff and consider merging them to the main repository if they are deemed acceptable.

- Sharing the project with others will be easier as no one will be required to have previous experience with version control or Git.
- What would be harder is managing communication, keeping track of commits, branching out copies for experimentation and bug fixes while keeping the main folder up to date, applying change requests, tracking attribution. etc...

## When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I would make changes in separate branch when introducing new features, typically I'll test then merge them into master when they are ready for production. On the other hand, changes done in master will have an only objective - making build more stable or fixing bugs. Benefits for doing changes in a separate branch is that it will allow me to experiment without break my code, but that comes at the cost of having sometimes to manually merging and to deal with conflict resolution, while changing on master is more or less linear and straight forward.
